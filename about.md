# UserRate
UserRate allows <cy>**anyone**</c> to send a level to a moderator! A moderator can rate the level sent by <cy>**you**</c>, making a much more inclusive rating system.

## <cg>Commission</c>
This mod is a <cy>commission</c> for <cb>forestg10</c>, made by <cg>SorkoPiko</c>. If you want a <cr>custom mod</c> made <cb>just for you</c>, <cg>contact me</c> on [**Fiverr**](https://www.fiverr.com/sorkopiko/make-a-geometry-dash-mod-for-you).

## Usage
To send a level to a moderator, simply click the <cy>**"Send Level"**</c> button (blue button with a star) in the <cy>**left menu**</c> (where the copy button is) on the level info page (the one with the play button).
If you can't see the button, you might have to <cy>**click the up or down arrows**</c>, as if there are more than 3 buttons, they will be put on a <cy>**seperate page**</c>.

If a level is rated demon, simply click the <cy>**"Rate Demon"**</c> button (blue button with a demon) in the <cy>**right menu**</c> (where the leaderboard button is) on the level info page (the one with the play button).

A UserRated level will <cy>**not award any stats**</c> to the player, as it is not an official rating. If you see a level with a rate that <cy>**doesn't award any stars**</c>, that means it is <cy>**UserRated**</c>.

## Moderation
All levels are rated by <cy>**moderators**</c>. They review all sent levels and decide on a rating.
